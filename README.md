# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project is a basic machine learning model created to predict a heart disease in a human based on the features selected in this prediction. 

As per a survey, it has been observed that heart related diseases have become one of the most contributing disorder in mortality rate in infants, children and in adults as well due to the changing demographic and eazting habits in humans. Specially, the young generations, the "Genz" people have started to adopt eating all kind of junk food that leads to bad health conditions such as high blood pressure, severe chest pain , imbalanced cholestrol level, etc. 

Using our machine learning skills ,I've created a fine tuned model which can predict the possibility of heart disease in a person upto 96% of accuracy. 
Here, the dataset used was initially collected from the UCI repository but later, merged with our own survey dataset in order to make the dataset available more diverse in terms of the values.
